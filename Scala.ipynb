First, immutable objecsts are easier to reason about than mutable ones, because the do not have complex state spaces that change over time. Second, you can pass mutable objects around quite freely, wwhereas you may need to make defensive copies of mutable objects before passing them to other code. Third, there is no way for two threads concurrently accessing an immutable object to corrrupt its state once it has been properly constructed, because no thread can change the state of an immutable object. Forth, immutable objects make safe hashtable keys, If a mutable object is mutated after it is placed in a hashSet, for example, that object may not be found the next time you look into the HashSet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main disadvantage of immutable object is that they somethimes require that a large object graph be copied where otherwise an update could be done in place. In some cases this can be arkward to express and might also cause a performance bottleneck.
